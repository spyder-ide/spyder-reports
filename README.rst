Important Announcement: Spyder is unfunded!
-------------------------------------------

Since mid November/2017, `Anaconda, Inc <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ has
stopped funding Spyder development, after doing it for the past 18
months. Because of that, development will focus from now on maintaining
Spyder 3 at a much slower pace than before.

If you want to contribute to maintain Spyder, please consider donating at

https://opencollective.com/spyder

We appreciate all the help you can provide us and can't thank you enough for
supporting the work of Spyder devs and Spyder development.

If you want to know more about this, please read this
`page <https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Anaconda-stopped-funding-Spyder>`_
